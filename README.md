- Objects
- Modularity
- DRY(Don't repeat yourself)
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- Interfaces
- Abstract Classes
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

The objective is to define the needs of an Uber trip to provide a solution through the OOP paradigm, not to repeat variables or information, to reuse variables, methods and functions of each of the classes or java files that are in charge of a specific function

For example this is a Adopt system of pets analyzed with OOP paradigm that I made:
